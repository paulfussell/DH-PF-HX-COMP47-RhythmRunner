Synopsis

Rhythm Runner was a game created by a group of students named Paul Fussell, Hongyou Xiong, and Dillon Hour. 
This game combines multiple game genres together such as the 2D platformer game, and endless runner style game.
The tools used to created this game was Unity's game platform, as well as some free assets that were retrieved 
on the web. Scripts and codes were written in C# and followed a strict coding guideline to keeps things uniformly. 
The main focus for this game was not only to combine multiple genres in one game, but also to implement music
and sounds as well. Additionally, sound frequencies will be effected according to the players mvoements. 

Motivation

We wanted to bring back the old classic games that involved music. Now a days, games are more focused on the bloody 
violence. So, we wanted to switch over to the clasic 8-bit sound games.
